# Take-Arms-GameJam

## Idea
It's going to be a top-down 2D survival scavenger game in a post apocolyptic suburban/urban area. The enemies are robots, and you play as Jakobs, a craftaholic hobo who take the parts from the robots and is able to build and upgrade weapons. The feeling is supposed to be more dark and dreary, with robots lighting up the area. Different types of weapons/attatchments are more effective against certain enemy types. He will be using his alley way between a fisheman's shop and another store as a crafting area. Want to add in some sort of permanence inbetween games, so if you die, you don't lose absolutely.

## Weapon types
There may or may not be 4 different weapons types depending on how much time we have:
### Regular
Effective against **regular** enemies
### Melee
Effective against **light/fast** enemies
### Heavy
Effective against **powerful/large** enemies
### Special
**Not yet in effect**, or may not be in effect

Switch between weapons using the scroll wheel or number keys

## Look and feel
### Jakobs
The idea was his beard makes up most of his face, he wears a orange beanie, and uses makeshift weapons.
### Setting
Dreary, rainy feel with the lights of the robots almost lighting up the atmosphere
